            <p class="fadeIn">I'll get this chance to confess on you about my feelings.</p>
            <p class="fadeIn">This might end up our friendship, closeness but I still hope that you'll listen.</p>
            <p class="fadeIn">I know that it's too obvious that I like you, even on my post, notes, mydays.</p>
            <p class="fadeIn">To be honest, I am afraid to tell you about my feelings. Afraid of rejection.</p>
            <p class="fadeIn">The day I first met you, I'm amazed by your beauty and cuteness (seryoso idol-idol ra unta tika before, pero ambot ngano).</p>
            <p class="fadeIn">Seryoso te, ambot lang ngano kaha ay. Trip-trip ragyud to nako before sulti nako nilang rendyl na (idol oh). Pero nadayunan man HAHAHAAHA.</p>
            <p class="fadeIn">I wanted to court you to know you more, but based on what you shared with me, I see you're not ready yet, and I don't think I have a chance.</p>
            <p class="fadeIn">I am doing my best at school because I am inspired by you. Like deym, it's an achievement that my grade improved because of you (nisaka te).</p>
            <p class="fadeIn">Like what I said to you before, maybe during sembreak or Christmas, I will confess. I don't know if you already knew, but I just want you to know that I liked you since day one.</p>
            <p class="fadeIn">And I wanted you to know also that I'm always here if you need something, or if you need help. I am always free!</p>
            <br>
            <span class="admire fadeIn">Admiring you from afar</span>
            <p class="fadeIn">Please enjoy the music on the next slide^^</p>
